## Introduction

A repository aimed at serving as a template, providing basic configurations for using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). It also includes a setup for use within a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), featuring optimized VSCode configurations for working with these technologies. Lastly, it incorporates [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) that automate the project [build](./.github/workflows/build.yml) and [release](./.github/workflows/release.yml).

## Usage

This template repository is not ready for immediate use. This is because it merely adds basic configurations for the various technologies, but both [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) need to be set up to work on either the server-side or client-side.

## Changelog
